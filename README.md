# tConfig

A repository holding common configuration values that I'd like to maintain
across multiple machines. It's currently limited to Windows and MSYS2-enabled
installations of Windows, but I'm hoping to expand into the Linux world soon.

## Repository Structure

```text
home/             files to stick in the user profile directory
  bin/            personal bin folder (accessible on PATH via addition from .bashrc)
windows/          Windows-specific settings to apply
homeWindows.lnk   shortcut to userprofile directory on Windows
```
